# Drank Full Stack Application
This is a full-stack application that lets a user create and view drinks. A user signs up and then proceeds to log in whereupon they create drinks with ingredients. The user can then access their created drinks and edit them as they please (including deletions).

## Approach
My intent for this project was to have 2 simple tables, a user and a drink with ingredients. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, however, I was then advised to use a join table. I started off by creating the back end and scaffolding my individual tables. Then I created my join table and proceeded to start making my front end. I decided to try out Bootstrap this bar and made my navbar with all of my Sign in, Up, and Out next to make sure my front and back end were connecting. After making sure they worked I attempted my CRUD. Once these were finished I added some basic CSS styling and deployed.

## Next Steps
I would love to fix my unsolved problems (listed below), but I would mostly like to attempt the design aspect next. I would enjoy playing around with the CSS and attempting different effects.

## Unsolved Problems
-  Hiding buttons on sign out
-  Hide show drinks after button is clicked
-  Displaying information in a pleasant way
-  Branding (entirely)/CSS
-  Showing drink ingredients

## User Stories
-  As a user, I want the app to be easily navigable so that I don't get lost.
-  As a user, I want to be able to edit my drinks in case I don't like them.
-  As a user, I want the site to be visually appealing so that I don't get bored or lose interest.
